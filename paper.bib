    abstract = {Gene expression data are exponentially accumulating; thus, the functional annotation of such sequence data from metadata is urgently required. However, life scientists have difficulty utilizing the available data due to its sheer magnitude and complicated access. We have developed a web tool for browsing reference gene expression pattern of mammalian tissues and cell lines measured using different methods, which should facilitate the reuse of the precious data archived in several public databases. The web tool is called Reference Expression dataset (RefEx), and RefEx allows users to search by the gene name, various types of IDs, chromosomal regions in genetic maps, gene family based on InterPro, gene expression patterns, or biological categories based on Gene Ontology. RefEx also provides information about genes with tissue-specific expression, and the relative gene expression values are shown as choropleth maps on 3D human body images from BodyParts3D. Combined with the newly incorporated Functional Annotation of Mammals (FANTOM) dataset, RefEx provides insight regarding the functional interpretation of unfamiliar genes. RefEx is publicly available at http://refex.dbcls.jp/.},

  abstract     = {Gene expression data have been archived as microarray and RNA-seq datasets in two public databases, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress (AE). In 2018, the DNA DataBank of Japan started a similar repository called the Genomic Expression Archive (GEA). These databases are useful resources for the functional interpretation of genes, but have been separately maintained and may lack RNA-seq data, while the original sequence data are available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). We constructed an index for those gene expression data repositories, called All Of gene Expression (AOE), to integrate publicly available gene expression data. The web interface of AOE can graphically query data in addition to the application programming interface. By collecting gene expression data from RNA-seq in the SRA, AOE also includes data not included in GEO and AE. AOE is accessible as a search tool from the GEA website and is freely available at https://aoe.dbcls.jp/.},
